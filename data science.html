    <h1>DATA SCIENCE LEARNING</h1>
    <h4>Teaching | Learning | Testing </h4>
    <p> Data Gathering is the first step of the machine learning life cycle. The goal of this step is to identify and obtain all data-related problems. In this step, we need to identify the different data sources, as data can be collected from various sources such as files, database, internet, or mobile devices. It is one of the most important steps of the life cycle. The quantity and quality of the collected data will determine the efficiency of the output. The more will be the data, the more accurate will be the prediction. 
        This step includes the below tasks:

        <ul>
         <li>Identify various data sources</li>
         <li>Collect data</li> 
         <li>Integrate the data obtained from different sources</li>
       </ul>

    <p> we have finalized the version of the model, it is time to test various metrics. Why? So that we can ensure that our model is ready for production. We will first test our model on a test dataset and make sure we involve subject matter experts to identify the error in the predictions. We also need to ensure that we follow industrial, ethical, and legal frameworks for building AI solutions. Furthermore, we will test our model for robustness on random and real-world data. Making sure that the model inferences fast enough to bring the value. Finally, we will compare the results with the planned success metrics and decide on whether to deploy the model or not. In this phase, every process is recorded and versioned to maintain quality and reproducibility. </p>
    <p>  In this phase, we deploy machine learning models to the current system. For example: introducing automatic warehouse labeling using the shape of the product. We will be deploying a computer vision model into the current system, which will use the images from the camera to print the labels. Generally, the models can be deployed on the cloud and local server, web browser, package as software, and edge device. After that, you can use API, web app, plugins, or dashboard to access the predictions. In the deployment process, we define the inference hardware. We need to make sure we have enough RAM, storage, and computing power to produce fast results. After that, we will evaluate the model performance in production using A/B testing, ensuring user acceptability. The deployment strategy is important. You need to make sure that the changes are seamless and that they have improved the user experience. Moreover, a project manager should prepare a disaster management plan. It should include a fallback strategy, constant monitoring, anomaly detection, and minimizing losses.</p>
